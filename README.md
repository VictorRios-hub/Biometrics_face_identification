### Lab Project:  Face Identification System

The objective of this project is the design of a robust face identification system from static images (in gray level)

We will study different classifiers (K-NN, SVM, CNNs), the impacts of different dimensionality reduction algorithms (PCA and LDA) on the learning and performance of classifiers, independently but also by combining them. We will use the dataset lfw_people.

#### Siamese network

Our second segment is dedicated to the siamese network, a one-of-a-kind architecture that has the ability to identify similarities or differences between entries.
